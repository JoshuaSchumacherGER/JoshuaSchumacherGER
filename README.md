### Hey 👋

💬 I'm a german vocational school teacher with a master's degree in Computer Science.

💬 I have worked for several years for various companies in different areas.

💬 Additionally, I hold a Cisco DevNet Instructor certification and I'm PSM certified.

💬  I am always interested in collaborating on new projects :).
    In my repositories, you will find either solutions to individual scripts I have written or smaller school projects.
